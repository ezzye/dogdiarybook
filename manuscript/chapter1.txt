# Chapter 1 - A Snake Swollowed My Code Book 
## Lost My Chromebook
Dan and Dora rush up stairs to the front of the 149 bus.  It was the first time they had been allowed to travel to their Russian lesson in Bethnal Green unsupervised by a grown-up.

The only other person on the top deck was an old man with the look of a retired teacher sitting near back staring out the window.  He looked uncomfertable while he read papers from a tatty document folder.  Dora ran downstairs with her brother Dan's mobile phone.  He followed in persuit.  When they arrived back upstairs Dan has got his phone back but he is sure that his bag has moved from where he left it.  It is now on the seat in front of the stranger.

## Spy on the bus
Just then the bus canme to a stop with a frightening bang.  It had hit a police car. The sranger got out and ran towards the stairs leaving a his folder behind.  He shouted, "I am done for.  That folder is my greatest treasure.  Solve its mystery and not only wll you save the UK from a terrible war but you will be rich beyond your dreams.  Use the three snakes to start-off."

Very strange thought the kids.

## Strange message
Later at home after their parents had gone to bed the kids read through the papers trying to make sense of it.  This is what the first message said,

"Goto Ubuntu
>>>python3 
*This takes you to python*
>>>exit
*This leaves python*
>>>

"
